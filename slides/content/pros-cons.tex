\section{Pros and Cons}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pros (the strength)}
  	Submodules let devide your repository into smaller parts.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item each submodule can be cloned individually.
		\item pushed commits from a submodule go directly to the specified origin (of the submodule).
		\item easy to distinguish between different projects (divided into multiple repositories)
		\item no disk space waste, only file with pointers exist.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Cons (well..)}
	Submodules lack of features and design consistencies.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item hard to get rid of obsolete submodules
		\item moving code between submodules can cause duplication, irritations and merge conflicts
		\item user has to manage modules via meta files like .gitmodules file
		\item required code must be cloned individually
	\end{itemize}
